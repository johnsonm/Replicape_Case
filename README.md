Obsolete
========

This remix + design was abandoned and replaced by my from-scratch
(Replicase)[https://github.com/johnsonm/Replicase] design, done
entirely in OpenSCAD.  I have no intention to do any further work
on this remix of Replicape Case.  You are welcome to use it, but
I have no plans to pay attention to PRs for this repository.


OpenSCAD remixes of Replicape case, changing ventilation.

# Summary

A case for the Replicape with vents for two 30mm fans.

Use #4-40 x 3/4" countersunk (or M3 x 20) for top case.
Use #4-40 x 1/4" or M3 x 6mm for mounting the beaglebone.

There is now a bottom case version with mounting holes.
